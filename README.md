# HUMAN-ACTIVITY-RECOGNISATION
Human Activity Recognition

Introduction
This project aims to develop a system for human activity recognition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify different activities performed by individuals based on sensor data collected from various sources, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.

Features
- Data Preprocessing: The project includes modules for cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering of sensor data.
- Model Development:** Various machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures are implemented for activity classification.
- Evaluation: Evaluation metrics and visualization tools are provided to assess the performance of the models.
- Deployment: The project also includes scripts and guidelines for deploying the trained models in real-world applications.
